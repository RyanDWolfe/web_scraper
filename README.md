# WebScraper

This WebScraper is not actually a web scraper! It connects to a news API from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) to retrieve the latest news headlines from the United States in your CLI.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. `ruby bin/web_scraper`

## Usage

Using this program is self explanatory, just follow the prompts to get to where you need. This program will list the latest news headlines, allow you to then read the description and visit the webpage for each news article. You can change the country or source from where you want to get your news. Once you have your news, you can also search the displayed news to find articles(s) that contain what you are interested in.
